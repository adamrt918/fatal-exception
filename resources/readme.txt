   FATAL EXCEPTION is an enemy encounter based RPG. You, brave hero, will face 
foes at every turn, in an effort to achieve your goal of defeating the endless 
tormenter, Infinite Loop. During your journey you must choose whether to use 
magic, strength, speed, or intelligence in order to fell your enemies. Every 
turn, the chance of encountering the boss increases until your final showdown 
with Infinite Loop. Will you attempt to fight your way to the end, increasing 
your statistics after every victorious battle? Will you bide your time, 
seeking to steal enemy experience in a game of wits? Or, perhaps you try to 
avoid conflict in a feeble attempt at outsmarting your final enemy...
                       --- The choice is yours, hero. ---
